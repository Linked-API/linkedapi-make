Linked API for Make connects your LinkedIn account to Make's automation platform, so you can build visual scenarios that search for prospects, send messages, manage connections, extract data, and more – all with [industry-leading safety](https://linkedapi.io/safety/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our Make app is currently private, so you'll need to install it via [this invitation link](https://www.make.com/en/hq/app-invitation/36b4987fef36b98761ccb61e7edea5e2?ref=linkedapi.io).

## Use cases
- **Lead generation pipeline**. Search for prospects matching your criteria, automatically send connection requests, wait for acceptance, then send personalized follow-up messages. Connect the results to your CRM to track everything in one place.
- **CRM synchronization**. When a new lead enters your CRM, automatically find their LinkedIn profile, send a connection request, and update the CRM with their LinkedIn data. Keep your sales pipeline enriched with real-time LinkedIn information.
- **Content engagement**. Monitor when your target accounts post on LinkedIn, automatically react or comment on their posts, then log the engagement in your tracking spreadsheet. Build relationships at scale without losing the personal touch.
- **Recruitment workflows**. Search for candidates with specific skills, send personalized InMails through Sales Navigator, track responses in your ATS, and automatically follow up with interested candidates. Streamline your entire recruitment funnel.
- **Multi-channel outreach**. Combine LinkedIn with email, Slack, and other channels. When someone accepts your connection request, trigger an email sequence, notify your team in Slack, and create a task in your project management tool.
